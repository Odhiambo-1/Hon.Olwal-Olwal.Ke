            independence and avoid social isolation.
            Charles Olwal is seeking to create services aimed at the elderly and those who have mental illness, learning
            disability and physical disability in Central Kasipul. The main aim in providing community care services is
            to
            enable people to remain living in their own homes and to retain as much independence as possible, avoiding
            social isolation.
            Mheshimiwa will work hand in hand with the Community Health Workers and Local authority social services to
            provide community care services or arrange for them to be provided for efficiency.
            Care needs can be difficult to gauge and provision also involves matching residents expectation, finances
            available and people willing to do the job. This will as well create employment opportunities
            to our residents.

            are
            highly encouraged to obtain the NHIF services)
            Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs (SNAP or "food stamps"). This will apply to the aged and the ill
            health individuals
            Supplemental Security Income (SSI) kitty and welfare groups formation that will provide income to the aged
            and
